Hello my names are byiringiro saad

I am a frontend developer and a graphics designer by professional and love for the work i do;
i have 4 years of experience and i have worked on a number of projects (you can check my resume)

I live in Rwanda (Africa) and i can either work remotely or onsite, the essential is that i solve a problem
and bring an impact to the society and the world at large.

I am applying for this job because i want to use my skills to help people and improve their lives in one way or another
i don't care if they are in Rwanda, Africa, the essential is that someone on earth is smilling because of the work i've done.

Thanks in advance for this opportunity, am looking forward for your reply.
